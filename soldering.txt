Go to Google and input Soldering Irons,

A number of selection will appear: I saw and listened to the selection: How to
Choose a Soldering Iron, by a technician with Radio Shack. About a 3 minute
video on the subject. 

If you are going to deal with electronic components like Integrated Circuits,
etc, you probably don't need a high wattage soldering iron, e.g. 35 - 40 watts.
Too, high a wattage can ruin heat sensitive circuits like ICs. When dealing
with heavier solids or thick wires, then higher wattage would be required. 

You can Google Soldering Guns to learn what they are about. I read it and came
convinced not to use it on sensitive electronic components. 

I don't think you need a temperature controlled soldering iron, An inexpensive
soldering iron with a stand to place it when not holding it and perhaps several
soldering tips would be all you need. Perhaps costing $25 -$30. When you take
your course, you may find you need a wire stripper/cutter. I have one that I
use and can show it to you.
