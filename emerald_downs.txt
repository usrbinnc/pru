In case you are interested, I am planning to go to Emerald Downs on Saturday,
Nov. 2nd to watch and bet on the annual Breeders Cup Races held at Santa Anita
Race Course (California), so it would be telecast races. Gary Stevens the
jockey will be riding in a number of these Breeder Cup Races. I just bought the
Racing Form and haven't reviewed it yet.

Let me know if you are interested in going,

Dad
