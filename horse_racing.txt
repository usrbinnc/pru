I googled for horse racing tracks near Pittsburgh and got Meadows Track and
Casino in Washington, PA. I don't know how close it is to Pittsburgh. But, you
have never seen harness racing and that is what raced there. I would think that
you can bet the Belmont Stakes race either at the track or its Casino. The
start times of the live harness races are given.

What day are you flying to Pittsburgh?
