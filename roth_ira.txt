David,

In 2015, I suspect you will be earning less than $129,000. This is the maximum
amount income allowed for eligible contributions to IRA accounts during the
year with a maximum contribution of up to $5,500 for the year. Since you will
be doing contract part-time work in 2015 is why I think you will be earning
less than $129,000.

So, your present Roth IRA account has no cash available for investments at this
time. You might consider applying on average about $500 a month contributions
to your Roth IRA account for investments.

Just a thought.

Dad
