Hi David,

I see that Herb Alpert (trumpet player with hit recordings in the 60s and 70s)
is in town performing at Jazz Alley, Thursday thru Sunday. Wondered if you
would be interested in going with me? If so, let me know and I will call and
make reservations if they are available. I can't go Friday, Barbara is
performing in Rajan's recital that day.

Dad
