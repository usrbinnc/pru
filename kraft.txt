Last night I decided to invest in Kraft Co. stocks today in my account, mainly
because they pay excellent dividends each year. Yesterday the share price was
about $61. I go online today to check the price and it is over $80 a share!
What happened? They announced a merger with Heinz Co. so the share price shot
up almost 40% in one day. I missed this fantastic deal by one day. Oh well.
