Hi David,

I just finished watching the movie Muscle Shoals, a 2013 DVD from Netflex.

If you haven't seen it I think you would like it. This is a tuneful documentary
chronicle of the musical legacy of Muscle Shoals, Alabama, home of the Fame
Studios, where top musicians have flocked for decades, creating hit rock and
roll recordings and perhaps the background of why they were so successful.
