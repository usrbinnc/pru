Secretariat was the best horse I ever knew and witnessed running. Looking at
his running time for the Kentucky Derby in 1973, it was about 4 seconds faster
than the running time of the Derby last Saturday. Given 1/5 of a second faster
equals one length means Secretariat would have been a winner by 20 lengths last
Saturday! That's how great he was. He did win the Belmont Stakes by 28 lengths.
He holds the speed records for all three races (Kentucky Derby, Preakness and
Belmont Stakes) since 1973.
